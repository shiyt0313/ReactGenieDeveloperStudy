# Welcome

Welcome to the ReactGenie Developer Study!

**Please think aloud a little bit during the tasks.
You can just try to verbalize your thoughts so we can better understanding how you approach the task.**

Today, you will be building two multimodal applications using the ReactGenie framework.
We've prepared detailed instructions and documentation to assist you along the way.

We've put together a tutorial to help you learn ReactGenie. In the tutorial,
we'll show you how to build a simple Counter app.

In the task part, you need to build a timer app. We've provided a skeleton app for you to start with.
You can use Counter we built in tutorial as a reference to build a timer app.

We've also provided documentation for ReactGenie that you can consult for specific features
of ReactGenie.

Please move on to the Instructions section when you're ready to start the study!
