# Welcome

Welcome to the ReactGenie Developer Study!
Today, you will be building a multimodal Timer App using the ReactGenie framework.
We've prepared detailed instructions and documentation to assist you along the way.

We've put together a tutorial to help you learn ReactGenie before you build a timer app. 
In the tutorial, we'll show you how to build a simple Counter app. You can use this as a reference
to build a timer app.

We've also provided documentation for ReactGenie that you can consult for specific features
of ReactGenie.

Please move on to the Instructions section when you're ready to start the study!
