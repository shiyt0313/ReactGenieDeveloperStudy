## 1. Introduction
When multimodal interaction is introduced into applications, 
users’ input information becomes diverse, which presents challenges for the functionality of the application itself. 
In this experiment, we hope that you can improve an existing multimodal interaction application to 
support users’ interaction needs as much as possible. 
The experiment will be divided into two parts. 

In the first part, 
you will improve the application based on your own thinking and the expected use of the application. 
In this process, you can modify the functionality based on your development experience or understanding of the application, 
with the goal of supporting as many possible multimodal inputs from users.

In the second part, 
you will use our multi-modal application development tool, GenieWizard, to improve the multi-modal application. 
We will provide a detailed introduction to the features and usage of GenieWizard in the next section.

After completing the two parts of application optimization tasks, you will need to complete a research questionnaire.
